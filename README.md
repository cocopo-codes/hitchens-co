## Hitchens-Co 
(Hitchens theme, edited by Corissa)

An inarguably well-designed [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme by [Pat Dryburgh](https://patdryburgh.com) and edited by Corissa Haury.

## Quick Start

Check out the original instructions at [Pay Dryburgh's repository](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens/).

## Manual Installation

If you've already created your Jekyll site and are comfortable with the command line, you can add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'cocopo-codes-hitchens-theme', '~> 0.1.0'
```

And add the following lines to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: corissawex-hitchens-theme
```

Depending on your [site's configuration](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/), you may also need to add:

```yaml
ignore_theme_config: true
```

And then on the command line, execute:

    $ bundle

Or install the theme yourself as:

    $ gem install gem corissawex-hitchens-theme
